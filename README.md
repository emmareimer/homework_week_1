## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria 

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Refactoring

```
1. The html file has been refactored to include semantic html as well as accessibility options.

2. I included a header, nav, main, sections, aside, footer and h1-h4. I've also included alt image text.

3. The CSS file has been refactored to include the semantic html elements as well as to be more concise and in order of how the elements appear on the page. I have included notes on the CSS file to explain what the styling is doing to the page in places where it is unclear as well as to be able to find the elements in the file. 
```
