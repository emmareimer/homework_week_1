The html file has been refactored to include semantic html as well as accessibility options.

I included a header, nav, main, sections, aside, footer and h1-h4. I've also included alt image text.

The CSS file has been refactored to include the semantic html elements as well as to be more concise and in order of how the elements appear on the page. I have included notes on the CSS file to explain what the styling is doing to the page in places where it is unclear as well as to be able to find the elements in the file.
